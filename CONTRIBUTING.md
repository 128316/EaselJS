#### Guidelines

We welcome pull requests on fixes, documentation updates, and even features. Ideally changes are discrete, documented inline with current standards, and don't contain superficial changes like tab formatting an entire file (hard to accept a PR that has 1000 changes). We also prefer don't contain the built docs/libs -- which we typically do once changes are integrated into the library.
